## Good habits
### Note what is said
Everytime someone speaks with you, write a sumary (*minute*) of what has been said. Separate topics in different files so that you can classify them. It should contain :
* When (YYYY:MM:DD @ HH:MM[:SS])
* How (call, talk)
* Destination (to, from)
* Who
* What

**Example** :

In `20190212-184800_pvpf_Eric-Bernard.odt`
>**2019-02-12 @ 18:48**
>
>Appel de *Éric Bernard*
>
>Suivi sur le projet de *lotissement municipal* (**ref. 345945sd-45g**)
>
>Lui envoyer le plan produit

### Record every call
While the minute should be detailed enough not to need it, having it never is a bad thing for transparency, either way. Use one the multiple apps to do so. Place the file with the associated minute.

### Use text styling to ease reading
When writting, use character styling like **bold**, *italtic* and ~~underlined~~ to highlight important parts of the text to ease and organise your contents. It allows to find key informations faster when reviewing for them.
Here what each style should mainly be used to represent :

||bold|italic|underlined|
|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Category**|*principal*|*names*|*other names*|
|**Elements**|units, references, captions, core message| organisations, persons, regulations|places, addresses, dates, times, periods|

### Use pencil colors
Using color is a good way to give additional information without unnecessarily adding details. For instance, when filing official documents or signing, use blue. That way, it's easier to differentiate between an original and its copies. In sketches, black is existing, red is proposed and blue is comment.

### Scan every document
As soon as you produce a new physical document, scan it and classify it according to this project guidelines. This way you should never have to go fetch it in the archives and you will be able to use it digitally.

### Always keep the original
Everytime a physical document is produced and completed amongst multiples entities, always keep an original. A copy will never be as good as an original to assert its content.

### Sign you documents
Make sure every physical document produced is easily relatable to it’s producer, either by its handwriting or preferably with a dated signature.

### Document yourself
Like the present project, it is important to document your methods. **You** might be **used to** what **you** do everyday, **but you're** likely **the only one**. Having them written down is the best way to keep track and improving them. Time will come when you have to transfert that personnal know-how. This way, you will be able to share it to coleagues or newcomers. Moreover, you should have a lifelong to your identify and adjust your processes.
